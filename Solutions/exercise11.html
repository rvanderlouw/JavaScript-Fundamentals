      The first planet is Mercury, barren and baking hot<br />
      The next planet is Venus, it's like an oven under its thick clouds<br />
      Then there is the wonderful Earth with its relatively large moon<br />
      Next up is Mars, cold and extremely dry<br />
      Then you will find the asteroids, such as Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, Hygiea, etc<br />
      Then there is the giant Jupiter, including its red spot and four large moons<br />
      Beyond Jupiter is Saturn, with its wonderful rings and its many moons<br />
      Even further out is Uranus, icy and blue, but too faint to be seen<br />
      Neptune is even farther away, even colder, and slightly heavier then Uranus<br />
      Still further out there are many dwarf planets such as Pluto, Eris, Haumea, Makemake, 
      Sedna and dozens of others...
